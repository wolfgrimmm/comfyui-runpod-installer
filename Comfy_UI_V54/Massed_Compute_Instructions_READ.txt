Select RTX A6000 or Better GPU - like L40S or A6000 ADA or A100 or H100 - best is RTX 6000 PRO

Use thinclient or login patreon on Massed Compute to download files on to your Massed Compute

Put everything into a folder in like desktop or downloads

Don't run scripts from inside of synchronization folder 

Move zip file into downloads folder and extract there

Open a terminal in the folder where you did put the files

To install run below command

chmod +x Massed_Compute_Install.sh
./Massed_Compute_Install.sh

To download IP Adapter Models open another terminal in the folder where you insalled ComfyUI and run below py files
Download_IP_Adapters_Fast.py file will download all of the currently known IP Adapters and Face IDs into accurate folders - 22 September 2024

pip install huggingface_hub hf_transfer hf_xet --upgrade
export HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1
python Download_IP_Adapters_Fast.py

To download major models I recommend use our unified AI downloader - ultra fast download here : https://www.patreon.com/posts/114517862

To use after install

Open a new terminal in the folder where you downloaded files and executed

cd ComfyUI
source venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8188 --use-sage-attention


if you want to directly access get your server ip from Massed Compute interface

e.g.

http://216.81.245.200:300/

this is normally to connect it via browser

replace :300 part with 8188

so e.g.

http://216.81.245.200:8188

This will let you connect your machine. remember this will be unencrpyted traffic so your ISP and network manager etc can monitor entire traffic 

If you need more secure way you can use ngrok

To access ComfyUI from your computer not inside Massed Compute we need to use ngrok

Get your ngrok token here : https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

Open a new terminal and execute below command after Comfy UI started

ngrok config add-authtoken replace_your_token_here

ngrok http 8188

Open ngrok generated link and click visit site

Example ngrok generated link : https://6058-64-247-196-42.ngrok-free.app


to start with multiple gpus and on each gpu different comfyui as below

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1
cd ComfyUI
source venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8189 --use-sage-attention
