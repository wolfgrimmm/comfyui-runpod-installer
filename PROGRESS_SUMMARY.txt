ComfyUI RunPod Docker Installer - Progress Summary
=====================================================

üéØ OBJECTIVE
Create an automated ComfyUI installer for RunPod using Docker with RTX 5090 support (requires CUDA 12.8+)

‚ö†Ô∏è MAIN CHALLENGE
Docker Build Cloud storage limitations - keeps running out of space during build process

üîÑ APPROACHES TRIED

1. Large PyTorch Base Image ‚ùå
   - Base: runpod/pytorch:2.8.0-py3.11-cuda12.8.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu22.04
   - Error: "no space left on device" when writing PyTorch CUDA libraries
   - Issue: Base image too large for Docker Build Cloud

2. Multi-stage Build ‚ùå
   - Approach: Build stage + runtime stage
   - Runtime base: runpod/pytorch:2.8.0-py3.11-cuda12.8.1-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu22.04
   - Issue: Runtime base image doesn't exist

3. Minimal CUDA Base with UV ‚ùå
   - Base: nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04
   - Issues: "uv: command not found", PATH problems between Docker layers
   - UV installation not persisting across RUN commands

4. Simplified with Regular Pip + Python 3.11 ‚ùå
   - Issue: Python 3.11 not available in Ubuntu 22.04 default repos
   - PPA approach failed with exit code 100
   - Deadsnakes PPA installation failing

5. Current State: Python 3.10 + Regular Pip ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Using default Python 3.10 from Ubuntu 22.04
   - Updated wheel files from cp311 to cp310
   - Status: Still testing, last known state

üìã CURRENT CONFIGURATION
- Base Image: nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04
- Python Version: 3.10 (Ubuntu default)
- Package Manager: Regular pip (no uv)
- PyTorch: cu121 index for CUDA 12.x support
- Custom Nodes: ComfyUI-Manager, IPAdapter Plus, ReActor, GGUF, Impact Pack
- AI Packages: Flash Attention, XFormers, InsightFace, etc.

üöß NEXT STEPS TO CONSIDER
1. Use GitHub regular runners instead of Docker Build Cloud (more storage)
2. Build locally with more disk space
3. Find smaller CUDA 12.8+ base image
4. Use conda instead of pip for better dependency management
5. Remove some custom nodes to reduce build size
6. Try different package installation strategies
7. Consider splitting into multiple smaller images

üìÅ CURRENT FILE STATUS
- Dockerfile: Updated for Python 3.10 + minimal CUDA base
- comfy_install_script.sh: Converted from uv to pip, cp310 wheels
- .github/workflows/build.yml: Still using Docker Build Cloud

üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS
- RTX 5090 requires CUDA 12.8+ 
- Docker Build Cloud has storage limitations
- PyTorch CUDA libraries are very large
- Multi-stage builds didn't solve storage issue
- Path/environment variable persistence issues with uv

üí° CORE ISSUE
The fundamental problem is Docker Build Cloud storage limits combined with the CUDA 12.8+ requirement for RTX 5090. The large CUDA development libraries exceed available build storage.

üìä ERROR PATTERNS SEEN
- "no space left on device" - Storage exhaustion
- "uv: command not found" - PATH issues
- "exit code: 100" - Package installation failures  
- "file not found" - Script path issues

üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- CUDA 12.8+ support for RTX 5090
- Complete ComfyUI installation with custom nodes
- Automated build process
- Reasonable image size for deployment

Status: In Progress - Storage optimization needed
