Register for Massed Compute using the following link I appreicate that a lot:
https://vm.massedcompute.com/signup?linkId=lp_034338&sourceId=secourses&tenantId=massed-compute

We have a special coupon for all GPUs : SECourses

If you want to learn more about GPUs and prices read this link : https://www.patreon.com/posts/126671823

Select RTX A6000 or Better GPU - like L40S or A6000 ADA or A100, H100 or RTX 6000 PRO - the bigger VRAM better for upscalers

Use thinclient or login patreon on Massed Compute to download files on to your Massed Compute

Put everything into a folder in like desktop or downloads

Don't run scripts from inside of synchronization folder 

I recommend just extract zip file into download folder on Massed Compute and run from there

Open a terminal in the folder where you did put the files

To install run below command

pip install huggingface_hub
chmod +x Massed_Compute_Install.sh
./Massed_Compute_Install.sh

The installer will auto download models. But if you get any error after, run below command and it will resume download and fix errors

Open a terminal in same folder and run below command

python Download_Models.py

To run it again after install just open a CMD where you installed - installation will auto start the app so use this later for re-starting the app

cd Ovi_Pro
git pull
source venv/bin/activate
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore
python3 premium.py --share



If you want to rent a machine with multiple GPUs you can follow following strategy

So with below strategy we limit started app to GPU 1 and changing default output dir so wont overwrite each other


cd Ovi_Pro
git pull
source venv/bin/activate
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore
python3 premium.py --share --output_dir "/home/Ubuntu/Downloads/outputs1"
