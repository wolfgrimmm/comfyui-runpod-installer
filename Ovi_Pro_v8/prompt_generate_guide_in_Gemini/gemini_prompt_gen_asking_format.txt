upload files in folder, modify below prompts as you need and use

if you want to generate anime or 3d or cartoon scenes, generate your image first and then use prompt to make it talking animation


single video clip generate

=====================

analyze the attached html file. it has lots of examples of ovi from official authors. moreover carefully analyze the research paper i uploaded  

i want 20 unique example cases for single 5 second generation

make all of them male characters , no sexy scene but interesting podcast and such scenes that would go viral

always include information and a speech related to my Youtube channel SECourses - it is a tech channel mostly focused on generative AI models

make sure that the scenes starts with face clearly looking at the camera position

when making speeches, don't make them too long or it can't generate properly

or if you think prompt needs to be 6 or 7 second, add beginning of the prompt the duration as {6} or {7} 

=====================


extend video generation guide below

=====================

based on the example prompts here i need you to write me some example cases

i need 20 unique cases where we will do 2 video extension + 1 base. so it will be 15 second videos

so the logic like this

first prompt generates first video
the the second prompt uses last frame of the first video
then the third prompt uses last frame of the second video

when writing prompts consider that each generation is 100% unaware of previous generations

0 data transfer

therefore we have to extremely carefully plan prompts individually but that will make it coherent

so we have to make it in a way that the face of the person won't be lost at the final frame of first and second videos

so the character has to be in a position looking at the camera

make characters close shot videos

make scenes good lightning not dark etc 

make sentences small like in given examples when they are longer they cant speak all and finish 

so first line prompt generates first video
second line prompt generates second video
third line prompt generates third video and i merge all at the end
plan logic making scenes and prompts
make final prompt speaking about Youtube channel SECourses where i teach AI
making speakings shorter as i said look at the examples 

now 1 important thing is that we want speaking sound to be coherent between different videos
therefore in <AUDCAP><ENDAUDCAP> section define sound in extreme details for model to generate same sound in each video define unique characteristics 

so make videos like podcast or like blog format easier for model to generate close shot persons talking

make persons and characters interesting try to write realistic human like heroes or humans but not anime or 3d render etc 

make all of them male characters , no sexy scene but interesting podcast and such scenes that would go viral

so make a good plan and understanding and then write the prompts 

put 2 spaces between each prompt group when giving me back prompt groups - each prompt is 3 lines and no need spaces between them

dont give titles etc just prompts
