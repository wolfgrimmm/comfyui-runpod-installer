UI REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY
========================

USER REQUIREMENTS:
- Simple UI for user selection before starting ComfyUI
- Each user gets their own pod with separate GPU (not sharing)
- UI runs on port 7777, ComfyUI on port 8188
- Users can only access ComfyUI through the UI (must select user first)
- Very simple UI to start with - can improve later

ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
1. Single container setup (UI + ComfyUI in same container)
2. Users cannot access ComfyUI directly - must go through UI first
3. One user per pod model (each artist gets their own RunPod pod)
4. No user authentication needed - simple dropdown selection
5. UI should auto-start when pod starts

USER/FOLDER STRUCTURE:
- Each user has their own folders:
  - /workspace/input/[username]/
  - /workspace/output/[username]/
- When user selects their name and starts ComfyUI:
  - System creates symlinks: ComfyUI/input -> /workspace/input/[username]
  - System creates symlinks: ComfyUI/output -> /workspace/output/[username]
- All outputs save to user-specific folders

USER MANAGEMENT:
- Default user: "serhii" 
- Simple user selection from dropdown
- Can add new users on the fly
- No passwords or authentication
- No user conflicts (since each pod is for one person)

WORKFLOW:
1. Artist deploys their personal RunPod pod
2. Pod auto-starts UI on port 7777
3. Artist visits UI and selects their username
4. Clicks "Start ComfyUI" button
5. ComfyUI starts with their folders mapped
6. UI redirects to ComfyUI on port 8188
7. All work saves to their named folders

KEY POINT:
Each artist/user gets their own dedicated pod with their own GPU. 
The UI is just for organizing their work into user-named folders, 
not for managing multiple concurrent users.
